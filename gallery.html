        <p class="p1"><span><b>Minar-e-Pakistan</b></span> (Urdu: مینارِ پاکستان, literally "Tower of Pakistan") is a tower located in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan.[1] The tower was built between 1960 and 1968 on the site where the All-India Muslim League passed the Lahore Resolution (which was later called the Pakistan Resolution) on 23 March 1940 - the first official call for a separate and independent homeland for the Muslims of British India, as espoused by the two-nation theory. The resolution eventually helped lead to the creation of Pakistan in 1947.[2][3]

The tower is located in the middle of an urban park, called the Greater Iqbal Park.[4]</p>
